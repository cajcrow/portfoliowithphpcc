			<h1>Common Exercises</h1>
			<p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as 
			part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Burpee</dt>
					<dd>Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength and 
					endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your 
					hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and 
					then jump up from a squatted position.</dd>
					<button onclick="burpees()">See example</button><!--validator says should not have w/in <dl>, but this is position specified in book-->
				<dt>Plank</dt>
					<dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push up position 
					and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.</dd>
					<button onclick="plank()">See example</button><!--validator says should not have w/in <dl>, but this is position specified in book-->
				<dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
					<dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a 
					push up position, then bring one knee up to your elbow then switch as quickly as you can 
					as though you were climbing a mountain.</dd>
					<button onclick="mtnClimber()">See example</button><!--validator says should not have w/in <dl>, but this is position specified in book-->
